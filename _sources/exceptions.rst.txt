.. _exceptions:

Exceptions and Errors
*********************

Python uses :class:`exceptions <Exception>` to indicate an error has
happened.  The SQLite library uses `integer error codes
<https://www.sqlite.org/rescode.html>`__.  APSW maps between the two
systems as needed.  Exceptions raised in Python code called by SQLite
will have that exception present when control returns to Python, and
SQLite will understand that an error occurred.

Chaining
--------

When an error is reported to SQLite, it may take further actions.  For
example errors in :doc:`VFS <vfs>` can result in error recovery
attempts, while an error in a window function step method will result
in the final method being called to do clean up.  Your code
implementing those could also have additional exceptions.

When multiple exceptions occur in the same SQLite control flow then
they will be :pep:`chained <3134>`.  Python's traceback printing code
will show `all the exceptions
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-context>`__.


.. _unraisable:

Unraisable
----------

There are a few places where it is not possible for a Python exception
to be reported to SQLite as an error, and Python C code does not allow
destructors to report exceptions.  These exceptions are reported via
`sys.unraisablehook
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.unraisablehook>`__,
and if that is not present then `sys.excepthook
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.excepthook>`__.

`sqlite3_log <https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/log.html>`__ is also called
so that you will have the context of when the exception happened
relative to the errors SQLite is logging.

Exception Classes
-----------------


.. exception:: Error

  This is the base for APSW exceptions.

.. attribute:: Error.result

         For exceptions corresponding to `SQLite error codes
         <https://sqlite.org/c3ref/c_abort.html>`_ codes this attribute
         is the numeric error code.

.. attribute:: Error.extendedresult

         APSW runs with `extended result codes
         <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html>`_ turned on.
         This attribute includes the detailed code.

         As an example, if SQLite issued a read request and the system
         returned less data than expected then :attr:`~Error.result`
         would have the value *SQLITE_IOERR* while
         :attr:`~Error.extendedresult` would have the value
         *SQLITE_IOERR_SHORT_READ*.

.. attribute:: Error.error_offset

        The location of the error in the SQL when encoded in UTF-8.
        The value is from `sqlite3_error_offset
        <https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/errcode.html>`__, and will be
        `-1` when a specific token in the input is not the cause.



APSW specific exceptions
========================

The following exceptions happen when APSW detects various problems.

.. exception:: ThreadingViolationError

  You have used an object concurrently in two threads. For example you
  may try to use the same cursor in two different threads at the same
  time, or tried to close the same connection in two threads at the
  same time.

  You can also get this exception by using a cursor as an argument to
  itself (eg as the input data for :meth:`Cursor.executemany`).
  Cursors can only be used for one thing at a time.

.. exception:: ForkingViolationError

  See :meth:`apsw.fork_checker`.

.. exception:: IncompleteExecutionError

  You have tried to start a new SQL execute call before executing all
  the previous ones. See the :ref:`execution model <executionmodel>`
  for more details.

.. exception:: ConnectionNotClosedError

  This exception is no longer generated.  It was required in earlier
  releases due to constraints in threading usage with SQLite.

.. exception:: ConnectionClosedError

  You have called :meth:`Connection.close` and then continued to use
  the :class:`Connection` or associated :class:`cursors <Cursor>`.

.. exception:: CursorClosedError

  You have called :meth:`Cursor.close` and then tried to use the cursor.

.. exception:: BindingsError

  There are several causes for this exception.  When using tuples, an incorrect number of bindings where supplied::

     cursor.execute("select ?,?,?", (1,2))     # too few bindings
     cursor.execute("select ?,?,?", (1,2,3,4)) # too many bindings

  You are using named bindings, but not all bindings are named.  You should either use entirely the
  named style or entirely numeric (unnamed) style::

     cursor.execute("select * from foo where x=:name and y=?")

.. exception:: ExecutionCompleteError

  Execution of the statements is complete and cannot be run further.


.. exception:: ExecTraceAbort

  The :ref:`execution tracer <executiontracer>` returned False so
  execution was aborted.


.. exception:: ExtensionLoadingError

  An error happened loading an `extension
  <https://sqlite.org/loadext.html>`_.

.. exception:: VFSNotImplementedError

  A call cannot be made to an inherited :ref:`VFS` method as the VFS
  does not implement the method.

.. exception:: VFSFileClosedError

  The VFS file is closed so the operation cannot be performed.

.. exception:: NoFTS5Error

  The FTS5 extension is not present in SQLite.

.. exception:: InvalidContextError

  Context is no longer valid.  Examples include using an
  :class:`IndexInfo` outside of the :meth:`VTTable.BestIndexObject`
  method, a registered :class:`FTS5Tokenizer` when the underlying
  tokenizer has been deleted/replaced, or :meth:`Connection.vtab_config`
  when not inside :meth:`VTModule.Create`.

SQLite Exceptions
=================

The following lists which Exception classes correspond to which `SQLite
error codes <https://sqlite.org/c3ref/c_abort.html>`_.


General Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. exception:: SQLError

  `SQLITE_ERROR <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#error>`__.  The
  standard error code, unless a more specific one is  applicable.

.. exception:: MismatchError

  `SQLITE_MISMATCH <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#mismatch>`__. Data
  type mismatch.  For example a rowid or integer primary key must be
  an integer.

.. exception:: NotFoundError

  `SQLITE_NOTFOUND <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#notfound>`__.
  Returned when various internal items were not found such as requests
  for non-existent system calls or file controls.

Internal Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. exception:: InternalError

  `SQLITE_INTERNAL <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#internal>`__. (No
  longer used) Internal logic error in SQLite.

.. exception:: ProtocolError

  `SQLITE_PROTOCOL <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#protocol>`__. (No
  longer used) Database lock protocol error.

.. exception:: MisuseError

  `SQLITE_MISUSE <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#misuse>`__.  SQLite
  library used incorrectly - typically similar to *ValueError* in
  Python.  Examples include not having enough flags when opening a
  connection (eg not including a READ or WRITE flag), or out of spec
  such as registering a function with more than 127 parameters.

.. exception:: RangeError

  `SQLITE_RANGE <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#range>`__.  (Cannot
  be generated using APSW).  2nd parameter to `sqlite3_bind
  <https://sqlite.org/c3ref/bind_blob.html>`_ out of range

Permissions Etc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. exception:: PermissionsError

  `SQLITE_PERM <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#perm>`__. Access
  permission denied by the operating system.

.. exception:: ReadOnlyError

  `SQLITE_READONLY <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#readonly>`__.
  Attempt to write to a readonly database.

.. exception:: CantOpenError

  `SQLITE_CANTOPEN <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#cantopen>`__.
  Unable to open the database file.

.. exception:: AuthError

  `SQLITE_AUTH <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#auth>`__.
  :attr:`Authorization <Connection.authorizer>` denied.

Abort/Busy Etc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. exception:: AbortError

  `SQLITE_ABORT <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#abort>`__. Callback
  routine requested an abort.

.. exception:: BusyError

  `SQLITE_BUSY <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#busy>`__.  The
  database file is locked.  Use  :meth:`Connection.set_busy_timeout`
  to change how long SQLite waits for the database to be unlocked or
  :meth:`Connection.set_busy_handler` to use your own handler.

.. exception:: LockedError

  `SQLITE_LOCKED <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#locked>`__.  Shared
  cache lock.

.. exception:: InterruptError

  SQLITE_INTERRUPT <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#interrupt>`__.
  Operation terminated by `sqlite3_interrupt
  <https://sqlite.org/c3ref/interrupt.html>`_ - use
  :meth:`Connection.interrupt`.

.. exception:: SchemaChangeError

  `SQLITE_SCHEMA <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#schema>`__.  The
  database schema changed.  A  :meth:`prepared statement
  <Cursor.execute>` becomes invalid if the database schema was
  changed.  Behind the scenes SQLite reprepares the statement.
  Another or the same :class:`Connection` may change the schema again
  before the statement runs.  SQLite will retry before giving up and
  returning this error.

.. exception:: ConstraintError

  `SQLITE_CONSTRAINT <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#constraint>`__.
  Abort due to `constraint
  <https://sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html>`_ violation.

Memory/Disk
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. exception:: NoMemError

  `SQLITE_NOMEM <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#nomem>`__.  A memory
   allocation failed.

.. exception:: IOError

  `SQLITE_IOERR <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#ioerr>`__.  A disk
  I/O error occurred.  The :ref:`extended error code <exceptions>`
  will give more detail.

.. exception:: CorruptError

  `SQLITE_CORRUPT <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#corrupt>`__.  The
  database disk image appears to be a SQLite database but the values
  inside are inconsistent.

.. exception:: FullError

  `SQLITE_FULL <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#full>`__.  The disk
  appears to be full.

.. exception:: TooBigError

  `SQLITE_TOOBIG <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#toobig>`__.  String
  or BLOB exceeds size limit.  You can  change the limits using
  :meth:`Connection.limit`.

.. exception:: NoLFSError

  `SQLITE_NOLFS <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#nolfs>`__.  SQLite
  has attempted to use a feature not supported by the operating system
  such as `large file support
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_file_support>`_.

.. exception:: EmptyError

  `SQLITE_EMPTY <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#empty>`__. Not
  currently used.

.. exception:: FormatError

  `SQLITE_FORMAT <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#format>`__. (No
  longer used) `Auxiliary database
  <https://sqlite.org/lang_attach.html>`_ format error.

.. exception:: NotADBError

  `SQLITE_NOTADB <https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#notadb>`__.  File
  opened that is not a database file.  SQLite has a header on database
  files to verify they are indeed SQLite databases.


.. _augmentedstacktraces:

Augmented stack traces
======================

When an exception occurs, Python does not include frames from
non-Python code (ie the C code called from Python).  This can make it
more difficult to work out what was going on when an exception
occurred for example when there are callbacks to collations, functions
or virtual tables, triggers firing etc.

This is an example showing the difference between the tracebacks you
would have got with earlier versions of apsw and the augmented
traceback::

  import apsw

  def myfunc(x):
    1/0

  con=apsw.Connection(":memory:")
  con.create_scalar_function("foo", myfunc)
  con.create_scalar_function("fam", myfunc)
  cursor=con.cursor()
  cursor.execute("create table bar(x,y,z);insert into bar values(1,2,3)")
  cursor.execute("select foo(1) from bar")

+----------------------------------------------------------+

In the original traceback you can't even see that code in apsw was
involved. The augmented traceback shows that there were indeed two
function calls within apsw and gives you line numbers should you need
to examine the code. Also note how you are told that the call was in
`user-defined-scalar-foo` (ie you can tell which function was called.)

*But wait, there is more!!!* In order to further aid troubleshooting,
the augmented stack traces make additional information available. Each
frame in the traceback has local variables defined with more
information. You can use :meth:`apsw.ext.print_augmented_traceback` to
print an exception with the local variables.

Here is a far more complex example from some :ref:`virtual tables
<Virtualtables>` code I was writing. The BestIndex method in my code
had returned an incorrect value. The augmented traceback includes
local variables. I can see what was passed in to my method, what I
returned and which item was erroneous. The original traceback is
almost completely useless!

Original traceback::

  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "tests.py", line 1387, in testVtables
      cursor.execute(allconstraints)
  TypeError: Bad constraint (#2) - it should be one of None, an integer or a tuple of an integer and a boolean

Augmented traceback with local variables::

  Traceback (most recent call last):
