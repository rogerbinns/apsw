Extensions
**********

SQLite includes a number of extensions providing additional
functionality.  All extensions are disabled by default and you need to
:ref:`take steps <setup_build_flags>` to have them available at compilation
time, to enable them and then to use them.

If you get APSW from PyPI or are using SQLite from your Linux/BSD platform
then they all enabled usually.
