About
=====

**APSW** |version| **released** |today|

Use with `SQLite <https://sqlite.org/>`__ 3.41 or later, `Python
<https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ 3.6 and later.


What APSW does
--------------

APSW lets you get the most out of the `SQLite <https://sqlite.org/>`__
embedded relational database engine from Python, and the most out of
Python from SQLite.  APSW glues together the complete `SQLite C API
<https://sqlite.org/c3ref/intro.html>`__ and `Python's C API
<https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html>`__, staying up to date
with both SQLite and Python.

It is recommended to use the builtin :mod:`sqlite3 <sqlite3>` module
if you want SQLite to appear interchangeable with the other database
drivers.

Use APSW when you want to use SQLite fully, and have an improved
developer experience.  See more about the :doc:`differences between
APSW and sqlite3 <pysqlite>`.

Dependencies
------------

APSW has no dependencies other than Python itself.
