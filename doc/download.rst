Source and binaries
===================

You can download this release as binaries for Windows.  Just run the
executable corresponding with the Python version you are using.  The
Windows binaries all include the :ref:`FTS <ext-fts3>` and
:ref:`RTree <ext-rtree>` extensions.  (`FTS3_PARENTHESIS
<https://sqlite.org/compile.html#enable_fts3_parenthesis>`_ is on.)

.. note::

    Python 3.5 on Windows may have installation problems claiming Python isn't
    installed.  The cause is Python bug `25148
    <http://bugs.python.org/issue25148>`__.

Download in source form for other platforms or if you want to compile
yourself on Windows.  See the :ref:`recommended <recommended_build>`
way to build or all the :ref:`options available <building>`.

Some Linux distributions also have packages which may trail the SQLite
and APSW releases by a year, or more.  It is also possible to build
RPMs and DEB packages from the source, although this involves setting
up package management tools and various dependencies on your build
machine.

.. _verifydownload:

Verifying your download
=======================

Downloads are digitally signed so you can verify they have not been
tampered with.  Download and extract the zip file of signatures listed
above.  These instructions are for `GNU Privacy Guard
<http://www.gnupg.org/>`__.  (GPG is installed as standard on most
Unix/Linux platforms and can be downloaded for Windows.)

Verify

  To verify a file just use --verify specifying the corresponding
  ``.asc`` filename.  This example verifies the source::

      $ gpg --verify apsw-3.16.1-r1.zip.asc
      gpg: Signature made ... date ... using DSA key ID 0DFBD904
      gpg: Good signature from "Roger Binns <rogerb@rogerbinns.com>"

  If you get a "good signature" then the file has not been tampered with
  and you are good to go.

Getting the signing key

  You may not have the signing key available in which case the last
  line will be something like this::

   gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found

  You can get a copy of the key using this command::

    $ gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 0DFBD904
    gpg: requesting key 0DFBD904 from hkp server keyserver.ubuntu.com
    gpg: /home/username/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
    gpg: key 0DFBD904: public key "Roger Binns <rogerb@rogerbinns.com>" imported
    gpg: Total number processed: 1
    gpg:               imported: 1

  Repeat the verify step.

Source code control
===================

The source is controlled by Git - start at

easy_install/pip/pypi
=====================

APSW is **not** available at the Python Package Index (pypi) and hence cannot be
installed from it.  (A random person has put an outdated poor quality upload
under the APSW name.  It has nothing useful to do with this project.) The reason
for this is that the tools do not provide a way of providing options to the
setup.py included with APSW and hence there is no way for APSW to know if you
want SQLite downloaded, a consistent version of SQLite or the latest, to use a
system SQLite instead, error if an a system version is not available etc.  I
could pick a sensible default but everyone else using pypi would be
disadvantaged or worse get undesired behaviour (eg different versions of SQLite
depending on when a machine did an install).  Additionally the world of Python
packaging is going through another series of changes (distutils2 aka packaging)
so some solution may come out of that. I'm happy to work with anyone who has a
solution to this problem.

.. _really_want_pip:

I really want to use pip
------------------------

The following pip command line downloads APSW from github, SQLite from the
official site, and builds/installs with all extensions enabled.

.. pip-begin

Use this (all one command)::

    pip install --user https://github.com/rogerbinns/apsw/releases/download/3.16.1-r1/apsw-3.16.1-r1.zip \
    --global-option=fetch --global-option=--version --global-option=3.16.1 --global-option=--all \
    --global-option=build --global-option=--enable-all-extensions

.. pip-end
